 * The SY6500 Series Microprocessors represent the first fully 
 * software-compatible microprocessor family. This lineup includes 
 * various models that offer different addressable memory ranges, 
 * interrupt input options, and integrated clock oscillators. All 
 * SY6500 microprocessors maintain software compatibility within 
 * the family and share bus compatibility with the MC6800 series.
